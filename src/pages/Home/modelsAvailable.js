It adopts script unification wherever feasible to leverage transfer learning by lexical sharing between languages. Overall, the model supports five scripts Perso-Arabic (Kashmiri, Sindhi, Urdu), Ol Chiki (Santali), Meitei (Manipuri), Latin (English), and Devanagari (used for all the remaining languages).`,

TTS involves two different models - an acoustic model, which is responsible for generating waveform for a given text; and a vocoder model, which is responsible for synthesizing voice from the generated waveform. Currently, we use FastPitch and HiFi-GAN models.",
